- ðŸ‘‹ Here @KevinJoven11 !
- ðŸ˜ƒ I like do anything that have the word Quantum and Computing!
- ðŸ“™ My main interest is quantum hardware which combines my major with my passion.

You can look at all my repositories in which I did some problems and things that I think are interesting and useful for other people. 
All the problems have a percentage of completion in which I think that it is possible to add more information (as always).
